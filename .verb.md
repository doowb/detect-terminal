## Usage

```js
import detectTerminal from '{%= name %}';
// or
import { detectTerminal } from '{%= name %}';

console.log(detectTerminal()) //=> "iterm" (or whatever terminal you're using)
```

## Supported Terminals

The following terminals are supported. Detection is based on environment variables and process-level indicators to identify the terminal in use.

- bash
- zsh
- windows_cmd
- powershell
- vscode
- gnome_terminal
- iterm
- windows_terminal
- xterm
- tmux
- terminal_app
- terminal
- konsole
- xfce4_terminal
- terminator
- alacritty
- wezterm
- putty
- node
- sh
- fish
- mate_terminal
- rxvt
- csh
- tcsh
- linux_console
- hyper
- warp
- qterminal
- screen
- eterm
- dopamine
- conhost
- ksh
- truecolor_terminal
- termux
- vt100
- kitty

**Note:**

- Some items are shell names (like `cmd`, `sh` (Bourne Shell), `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, etc.) because the code's process-title detection maps those as possible values, and the code wasn't able to find a better terminal identifier.
- The names are as returned by the detection methods (i.e., `terminal_app`, `gnome_terminal`, etc.) and not the terminal program's real executable names. This approach was takenn to avoid confusion with the actual executable names, which can vary across platforms and installations.
- Fallback/auto-generated names (using sanitized env values) are also possible in the code but are not explicitly named in the code.

**Notes:**

- Detection uses the `TERM` and `TERM_PROGRAM` environment variables, as well as process-level indicators such as `process.title` on some platforms, to identify the running terminal.
- Variable values are normalized to provide a consistent terminal identifier, regardless of differences in capitalization or formatting.
- Some Windows terminals are detected using Windows-specific variables such as `COMSPEC` or `WT_SESSION`.
- Terminal multiplexers such as `tmux` and `GNU Screen` are identified through the `TERM` variable when active.
- When running inside Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal, detection relies on specific environment variables set by VS Code.
- Distinctions are maintained between terminal emulators (e.g., iTerm2, Konsole) and shells (e.g., bash, zsh), with shells excluded from the main detection table.
- In the absence of a recognized terminal, a fallback sanitizer produces a normalized identifier or `unknown` as a last resort.
- The detection logic is designed to cover terminals across UNIX-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows, providing broad compatibility for diverse development environments.

## History

### v1.1.0

- Improved terminal detection accuracy with more advanced detection methods
- Added `VTE_VERSION` detection to properly identify `GNOME` Terminal when it masquerades as xterm
- Implemented environment variable scanning to detect Konsole terminals that advertise as xterm
- Enhanced `COLORTERM` precedence handling for better terminal identification
- Added macOS path parsing to extract application names from full paths
- Improved Android/Termux detection with `TERMUX_VERSION` checks
- Enhanced Windows Terminal detection with `WT_SESSION` prioritization and pwsh support
- Added better error handling with timeouts for shell execution
- Refined process title matching with more precise regex patterns
